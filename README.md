# Community-Discussion
This is the repo for community discussions. Go to the discussions tab in this repo, and there you can create a discussion, or just comment on an already there discussion.

## Subscribe
There will be a discussion(called announcments) which is the basic one for community announcments. Go to that discussion, scroll down, and hit the button which says subscribe. The button will be on the right side. This is so you can get notifications on all the posts on this discussion.

## Fun
You can use the discussions tab and create new discussions just for fun and you can post random stuff in those discussions(not bad stuff or I can remove your access to this repo). You can have random comedy, such. People who help a lot by warning people not to post these kind of things or those kind of things might get promoted to the maintainer of the discussions so try to be as helpful as possible(ahap). You can also ask coding questions here, though this organization is for repl.it and in repl.it there is a [talk section](https://repl.it/talk/all) in which you can ask questions. I recommend that instead of this for coding based questions.

### Code
This repo is not for code so do not add code here.

### Public
This is a public repo because Private repos do not have discussions.

### Announcments
If we all are creating a project together on a specific language we have a team for, then I will post in that languages discussion we are creating a project in that language. No-one is in all the teams except me, so don't feel offended if you find out a project is happening in a language team you were not added to. You can post in the announcments discussion that you also know that language and we will add you.
